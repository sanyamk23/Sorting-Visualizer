# Sorting-Visualizer
Developed a Sorting Visualizer web project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Implemented various sorting 
algorithms (e.g., bubble sort, selection sort, merge sort, quick sort) with a visually intuitive interface, enabling 
real-time visualization of sorting processes. Enhanced understanding of algorithms through interactive 
visualization.
